Her mother, Dorota Świątek, is an orthodontist who provided a supportive environment for her athletic pursuits. Growing up with a sister, Agata, who initially played tennis before switching to dentistry, Iga was inspired to take up the sport herself.

From a young age, Świątek displayed a natural affinity for tennis. Her early training took place at Mera Warsaw, where she quickly outshone her peers. Recognizing her potential, her parents ensured she received the best possible training, which included moving to Legia Warsaw to further develop her skills.

Her prowess continued to grow, and she secured titles at prestigious events such as the Grade A Abierto Juvenil Mexicano and the Grade 1 Traralgon Junior International.

Her breakthrough in junior Grand Slam tournaments came in 2018 when she won the Wimbledon girls' doubles title with partner Caty McNally.
